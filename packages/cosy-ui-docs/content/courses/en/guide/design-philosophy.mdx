The design philosophy of the Cosy UI component library revolves around providing developers with an efficient, intuitive, and consistent development experience. We believe that an excellent component library should allow developers to focus on creative work rather than getting bogged down in tedious configuration and adjustments.

## Core Values

### Ready to Use

Each component is carefully designed to be usable immediately after import, without complex configuration processes. We are committed to lowering the barrier to entry, enabling developers to quickly integrate components into their projects.

```astro
---
import { Button } from '@coffic/cosy-ui';
---

<Button>Get Started</Button>
```

### Rich Configuration Options

While components satisfy most use cases in their default state, we also provide a rich set of configuration options, allowing developers to make personalized adjustments according to project requirements.

```astro
---
import { Button } from '@coffic/cosy-ui';
---

<Button variant="primary" size="lg" rounded>Custom Button</Button>
```

### Intuitive Usage

The API design of components is intuitive, following consistent patterns and naming conventions, making it easy for developers to understand and use. We believe that a good API should be predictable, allowing developers to naturally guess the correct usage.

### Complete TypeScript Support

All components provide complete TypeScript type definitions, offering code completion and type checking, reducing errors during development and improving efficiency.

```astro
---
// Enjoy complete type hints and checking
import { Card } from '@coffic/cosy-ui';
---

<Card
  title="TypeScript Support"
  description="Complete type definitions make development more efficient"
  footer="View More"
/>
```

### Visual Consistency

The component library provides a unified visual language, ensuring consistent appearance and interaction experience when used across different projects, helping organizations establish brand recognition.

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Avoid unnecessary complexity, provide clear and concise APIs
2. **Consistency**: Maintain visual and behavioral consistency between components
3. **Self-Contained**: Components should be as self-contained as possible, reducing external dependencies
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality is simple to use, advanced features are only exposed when needed
5. **Inclusive Design**: Focus on accessibility, ensuring components are friendly to all users

Through these design philosophies and principles, Cosy UI is committed to providing developers with a component library that is both beautiful and practical, making the development process more enjoyable and efficient.
